# Token Gated Platform with Ledger Integration

## Overview

This project implements a token gated platform where access to certain features or content is controlled by possession of specific tokens. The integration with Ledger hardware wallets adds a layer of security and usability by requiring users to verify transactions directly on their Ledger device.

## Features

- **Token Gating**: Users must possess specific tokens to access premium features or content.
- **Ledger Integration**: Secure signing of transactions using Ledger hardware wallets.
- **Web3 Integration**: Interaction with Ethereum smart contracts for token verification and access control.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend user interface development.
- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and API integration.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript for enhanced code quality and scalability.
- **Ethereum Blockchain**: Smart contracts for managing token transactions and access control.
- **Ledger Hardware Wallets**: Integration using `@ledgerhq/hw-app-btc` and `@ledgerhq/hw-app-eth` libraries for secure transaction signing.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mxber2022/EthGlobalSingapore
   cd EthGlobalSingapore
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary variables (e.g., Ethereum RPC URL, contract addresses, etc.).

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   yarn run dev
   ```

5. **Access the application:**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **Connect Ledger Device**: Connect your Ledger hardware wallet and follow on-screen instructions to authenticate transactions.
- **Token Management**: Use a compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to manage tokens required for accessing gated features.
- **Interact with Platform**: Navigate through the platform and experience token gated access firsthand.
